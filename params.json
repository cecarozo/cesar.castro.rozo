  "body": "This is a minimal example of a Jekyll-based website using knitr and R Markdown. The interesting bit of this repo is that you can actually serve the Jekyll website locally with R, and R Markdown posts can be compiled automatically, with the web pages automatically refreshed as well.\r\n\r\nAfter you are satisfied with the local preview, you can either just push the Markdown blog posts to your Github repo (e.g. the gh-pages branch), and let Github generate the website for you, or host the HTML files generated under the _site/ directory on your own server.",
